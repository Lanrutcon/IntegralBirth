# IntegralBirth
WoW AddOn - A sell list that is created whenever the player loots something

Inspired by **Torchlight's pet selling list**, ***IntegralBirth*** builds a list of items that will be sold when you visit a vendor.
Whenever you loot an item, you will be prompted if you want to add that item to the *sell list*.
You can also ignore an item, for example, if you are farming an item and you want to always keep that item.

The main objective is to save you time when interacting with merchants.

###How to use it:
---

After looting, a frame shows up. You can move it by dragging it with ***ALT*** key pressed.
Press ***Shift-LeftClick*** if you want to sell that item. ***RightClick*** if you don't.

If you add an item by mistake, you can remove from the list by using this slash command: **/intb remove itemLink**
To ignore an item, use this command: **/intb ignore itemLink** - Do the same thing if you want to stop ignore that item.
